# Tour de Frick (Now Moped Madness) Process
1 - For brainstorming, I wanted to turn shmups on their head. Most of my ideas relied on enemies coming from non-traditional places or making a shmup with RPG or Battle Royale aspects. These ideas were a little too large of a scope so I turned to resource management which can make for a fun experience. I didn't have a theme and spaceships are boring (said no one ever until now). Setting my final game is a bicycle race creates a weird dynamic of what people think a shmup should be.

2 - A big lesson I learned was about instantiation and how manager scripts can help with organization of game objects.I also learned that the character speed was a little too slow after I started sending enemies at faster speeds. It adds to the chaos which can be fun. People liked the weird car physics that happened when it collided with the banana so I tried hard keep that.
